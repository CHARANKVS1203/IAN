# IAN 

IAN - Intelligence Agent Network is a collective intelligence network designed to direct users to a more balanced truth.


IAN will be built with a blockchain based foundation to keep trust amongst agents and users decentralized and secure.


IAN is currently being built and tested behind closed doors but will be open-sourced in the near future.


In the meantime this repository will act as a community hub for IAN related contributions and requests.
